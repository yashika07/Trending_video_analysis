# Trending_video_analysis
YouTube is the world’s most popular and widely used video platform today. In this article, I’m going to introduce you to a data science project on YouTube trending videos analysis with Python programming language.
## Uses
We will analyze the data to get insight on trending YouTube videos, to see what is common among all trending videos. This information can also be used by people who want to increase the popularity of their videos on YouTube.
## About Dataset
The dataset that I will be using for the analysis of Youtube trending videos was collected over 205 days. For each of those days, the dataset contains data on trending videos for that day. It contains data on over 40,000 trending videos.
### Some Data Exploration 
1. The average number of views of a trending video is 2,360,784. The median value of the number of views is 681,861, which means that half of the trending videos have less than this number and the other half have views greater than this number.
2. The average number of likes for a trending video is 74,266, while the average number of likes is 3,711.
3. The average number of comments is 8,446 while the median is 1,856.
## Data Analysis Points
#### 1. How many trending video titles have at least one uppercase word (eg WHAT)?
#### 2. Analysis of the length of titles of videos, then plotting the title length histogram to get an idea of the length of trending video titles.
#### 3. Drew a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between the title length and the number of views. 
#### 4. How views and likes correlate, meaning that views and likes increase and decrease together?
#### 5. A word cloud for the titles of our trending videos, which is a way to visualize the most common words in the titles; the more common the word, the larger its font-size
